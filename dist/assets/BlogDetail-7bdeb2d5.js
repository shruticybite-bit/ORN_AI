      <p>The global job market is evolving faster than ever, and traditional education systems are struggling to keep pace. Today’s learners need more than just degrees—they need real skills, real confidence, and real opportunities.</p>
      <p>At ORN-AI, we are redefining what modern skill development looks like.</p>

      <h2>Why Hands-On Learning Matters</h2>
      <p>Most online courses stop at theory. The result? Learners complete programs but still lack real-world competence. ORN-AI solves this through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practical labs</li>
        <li>Real scenarios</li>
        <li>Case-based training</li>
        <li>Cross-technology exposure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach helps candidates build capabilities that employers recognize instantly.</p>

      <h2>Bridging the Gap Between Learning & Earning</h2>
      <p>With personalized CV writing, interview preparation, and ethical placement pathways, ORN-AI transforms training into tangible career outcomes—especially for expats and underserved regions.</p>

      <h2>Education Without Borders</h2>
      <p>Our expansion into European markets ensures global readiness. Whether you're preparing for a cybersecurity role in Germany or a cloud job in the UAE, our programs adapt to your goals.</p>

      <p><strong>ORN-AI isn’t just a platform—it’s a pathway to your future.</strong></p>
    `,thumbnail:"../../public/assets/blogs/1.svg"},{id:2,title:"Why Ethical Placement Matters — And How ORN-AI Is Changing the Game",excerpt:`
      <p>Fraudulent job channels, backdoor hiring, and unsafe employment practices have become dangerously common. Many candidates lose money, time, and even career credibility due to these traps.</p>
      <p>ORN-AI is built on the opposite philosophy: <em>ethics, transparency & long-term trust.</em></p>

      <h2>The Reality Many Students Face</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fake consultancies charge illegal fees</li>
        <li>Short-term roles with no contracts</li>
        <li>Hidden risks in international hiring</li>
        <li>No guidance after placement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These issues ruin confidence and reduce employability.</p>

      <h2>ORN-AI’s Ethical Career Model</h2>
      <p>We offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Merit-based job guarantees</em></li>
        <li><em>Zero backdoor or unethical pathways</em></li>
        <li><em>Transparent employer selection</em></li>
        <li><em>Post-placement mentoring</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every candidate is supported with CV upgrades, mock interviews, and market-aligned training so they enter roles confidently and safely.</p>

      <h2>A Safer Way Forward</h2>
      <p>In a world full of misleading promises, ORN-AI stands strong as a student-first platform—ensuring your growth, dignity, and future remain protected.</p>

        <li>Soft Skills & Leadership</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Real scenarios</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting tasks</li>
        <li>Industry case studies</li>
      </ul>
